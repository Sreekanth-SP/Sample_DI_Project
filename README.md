* It is the comparison of tight coupling and slightly better than the first code.
---
`Tight coupling refers to a situation where two or more software components are closely connected and depend on each other to function properly. Loose coupling, on the other hand, means that the components are less dependent on each other and can operate more independently`

### Benefits of Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection offers several advantages in software development:

**Loose Coupling** : Dependencies between components are reduced, making the code more maintainable and easier to test.
**Flexibility**: Dependencies can be easily swapped or modified, allowing for greater flexibility in the system's behavior.
**Testability**: Components can be easily tested in isolation by providing mock or stub implementations for their dependencies.
**Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts by injecting different implementations of their dependencies.
**Modularity**: Dependencies are explicit, making it easier to understand and reason about the codebase.
**Separation of Concerns**: Dependency Injection separates the responsibility of creating and managing dependencies from the consumer, promoting the Single Responsibility Principle.

### Types of Dependency Injection
There are *three main types* of Dependency Injection:

**Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided through a class constructor. The consumer class declares its dependencies as constructor parameters, and the dependency container resolves and injects them when creating an instance of the consumer class.

**Setter Injection**: Dependencies are provided through setter methods or properties of the consumer class. The consumer class exposes setter methods or properties for each dependency, and the dependency container injects them using these methods or properties.

**Interface Injection**: Dependencies are provided through an interface-specific method. The consumer class implements an interface with a method for injecting dependencies, and the dependency container invokes this method to inject the dependencies.

#### Implementing Dependency Injection
To implement Dependency Injection, you can follow these general steps:

1. Identify Dependencies: Determine the dependencies required by a class or component.

1. Decide Injection Type: Choose the appropriate injection type: constructor, setter, or interface injection.

1. Create Dependency Container: Set up a container or framework that manages the creation and injection of dependencies.

1. Configure Dependencies: Register the dependencies with the container, specifying how they should be instantiated and injected.

1. Apply Injection: In the consumer class, declare the dependencies as constructor parameters, setter methods, or implement the interface for injection.

1. Retrieve Instance: Obtain an instance of the consumer class from the container, which will automatically resolve and inject the dependencies.

### Conclusion

Dependency Injection is a powerful pattern that promotes loose coupling, testability, and modularity in software development. By removing the responsibility of managing dependencies from the consumer, it allows for more flexible and maintainable code. Implementing Dependency Injection involves
